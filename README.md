# Wild Code Plugin

## Overview
The Wild Code Plugin is an experimental QGIS plugin designed to explore and expand ideas without relying on automated tools like QGIS Plugin Builder or Qt Designer. This plugin will be built from scratch, focusing on creativity and flexibility.

## Goals
- **Learn by Doing**: Understand the QGIS plugin development process by coding everything manually.
- **Experimentation**: Test new ideas and features without constraints.
- **Simplicity**: Keep the plugin lightweight and easy to modify.

## Features to Explore
1. Add a custom toolbar button.
2. Display messages in the QGIS message log.
3. Interact with map layers (e.g., list layers, add/remove layers).
4. Perform basic spatial operations (e.g., buffer, intersection).
5. Create a simple GUI using PyQt (without Qt Designer).
6. Handle user inputs and display outputs.

## Development Plan
1. Set up the basic plugin structure.
2. Implement a simple action (e.g., log a message when a button is clicked).
3. Gradually add more features and refine the code.

## Notes
- This is a learning and experimentation project. Code quality and best practices will improve over time.
- Contributions and ideas are welcome!
